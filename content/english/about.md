I am a student interested in data science and genomics research interested in working with the MDH1 gene. I completed a project involving the arginine methylation of MDH1 by CARM1 in mouse gastrulation in a Clovis Community College class taught by Dr. Alcazar. I am fascinated with computational/molecular biology.
